Individuals with dyslexia can find it challenging to focus when reading large documents.

Simplexia's purpose is to address this issue by condensing lengthy texts into shortened summaries that make for easier reading.

By harnessing DeepAI's [text summary](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/summarization) and [text tagging](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-tagging) APIs, Simplexia simplifies the process of absorbing long documents by producing summaries, expanding acronyms and presenting lists of keywords.

**Acronyms** and their definitions can be accessed to the right hand side via a drop down list, allowing for key information to be recalled easily.

In order to enhance readability for dyslexic users, the colour of the background of text fields can be changed via a colour wheel.
